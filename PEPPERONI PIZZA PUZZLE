USE CASE:
A good classic accounting problem is to print an aging report of old billings. 
Letâ€™s use the Friends of Pepperoni, who have a charge card at our pizza joint. 
It would be nice to find out if you should have let club members charge pizza on their cards. 
You have a table of charges that contains a member identification number (cust_id), a date (bill_date), and an amount (pizza_amt). 
None of these is a key, so there can be multiple entries for a customer, with various dates and amounts. 

This is an old-fashioned journal file, done as an SQL table. What you are trying to do is get a sum of amounts paid by each member within an age range.
The ranges are 0 to 30 days old, 31 to 60 days old, 61 to 90 days old, and everything over 90 days old. 
This is called an aging report on account receivables, and you use it to see what the Friends of Pepperoni program is doing to you.

Sol:

select cust_id,'0-30 days' AS age, sum(pizza_amt) from Friends of Pepperoni
        WHERE bill_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE AND (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 30 DAY) GROUP BY cust_id
        UNION ALL
select cust_id,'31-60 days' AS age, sum(pizza_amt) from Friends of Pepperoni
        WHERE bill_date BETWEEN (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 31 DAY) AND (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 60DAY) GROUP BY cust_id
        UNION ALL
select cust_id,'61-90 days' AS age, sum(pizza_amt) from Friends of Pepperoni
        WHERE bill_date BETWEEN (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 61 DAY) AND (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 90DAY) GROUP BY cust_id
        UNION ALL
select cust_id,'90+ days' AS age, sum(pizza_amt) from Friends of Pepperoni
        WHERE bill_date<CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 90DAY GROUP BY cust_id
        UNION ALL
