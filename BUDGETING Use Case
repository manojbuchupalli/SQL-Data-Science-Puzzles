Mark Frontera at LanSoft, Inc., in Miami, Florida, posted this problem in September 1995. 
He has budgeting information that consists of the following three tables: the items to be paid for, 
the estimated amounts to be spent on them, and the actual amounts spent on them. I am going to skip the DDL and post the data,
since they are simple. Notice that some items are covered by more than one check, and sometimes one check covers several items

Items  
item_nbr   item_descr
=====================  
10        'Item 10'  
20        'Item 20'  
30        'Item 30'  
40        'Item 40'  
50        'item 50

Actuals
item_nbr  actual_amt   check_nbr 
=================================  
10       300.00         '1111'  
20       325.00         '2222'  
20       100.00         '3333'  
30       525.00         '1111'


Estimates
item_nbr  estimated_amt 
=========================   
10        300.00   
10        50.00   
20        325.00   
20        110.00   
40        25.00

output should be as follows:

item_nbr item_descr   actual_tot estimate_tot  check_nbr 
===================================================   
10       'item 10'     300.00   350.00       '1111'   
20       'item 20'     425.00   435.00       'Mixed'  
30       'item 30'     525.00     NULL       '1111'  
40       'item 40'       NULL    25.00        NULL
